# SMART-GLASSES With ARDUINO
This  presents a details outline of the proposed research project on  developing a smart glass using Arduino Uno.

From the past, disabled people had to face various challenges in life. They have used 
various methods to carry out their daily activities as ordinary people. Those methods 
were sometimes difficult and sometimes failed. Therefore, it was difficult to carry 
out their daily tasks as usual. As technology advanced, various technological devices 
were created for them, making it easier for them to carry out their tasks normally. 
Smart glass is a pair of glasses designed to make it easier for visually impaired 
people to easily identify obstacles in their path. 
The visually impaired people face various challenges in navigating their 
surroundings. To solve this issue, we have created the Arduino based smart glass. 
This is a smart glass equipped with ultrasonic sensors and MP3 module to detect 
obstacles and provide feedback via LEDs, buzzers. This device provides real-time 
feedback on obstacles in the path of visually impaired people with the aim of 
improving traffic safety. The Arduino Uno is an open source microcontroller board 
based on the ATmega328 chip that is well suited for the functionality of smart glass. 
Here we have used Ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) to detect the obstacles 
ahead. Smart glass is a very useful and successful solution for visually impaired 
people. This is valuable tool to help them minimize potential accidents.
